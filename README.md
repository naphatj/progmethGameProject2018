# progmethGameProject2018
This 2-person project is part of program methodology course at chulalongkorn university 2018.
The goal of this project is to create a java application using java and javafx.


Please read the projectreport.pdf to see the overview of the project including the project background, program transitioning and game flows, example screenshots from the program , and more details.

This was one of my early projects so with time constraints and lack of knowledge about sufficient planning,analysis and design.
My parter and I jumped into coding from scratch and fixing problems on the go. The end results was pretty impressive for ourselves but the object-oriented class-method and source codes was badly structered. It was a major flaw of our application and we did become aware of the problem in the very late state so we didn't have time to fix the problem. 

In the end,I learned a lot of things including how to make simple java program including basic gui, handling input from user,basic application control flows and most importantly planing/analysis of the project is not something to be looked over.
