This 2-person project is part of program methodology course at chulalongkorn university 2018.
The goal of this project is to create a java application using java and javafx.

#### What did I learn?
This was one of my early projects so with lack of knowledge about sufficient planning,analysis and design.
My partner and I just started the project by jumping into coding immediately and try fixing problems on the go.
The end output was pretty impressive for ourselves but the object-oriented class-method and source codes was badly structered. It was a major flaw of our application. We became aware of the problem in the later state of working when the codes and work for particular classes becomes bigger and bigger and we wanted to fix the problem but we couldn't figure out how to implement a solution because the problem is deeply rooted since start and with the time restaint, we decided to leave this part and continue implementing.

In the end, I learned a lot of things including how to make simple java program including basic gui, handling input from user,basic application control flows and most importantly planing/analysis/design of the project is not something to be looked over.
